Include benchmark calculations on git:
	Selected calculations.
	* make a folder with benckmarks

README file on git is very useful.

Unit tests/tests
	Tests 	| Analytical eigenvalues for harmonic oscillator
			| We have here the analytical solution
			| - non-interacting
			| - interacting case (Taut)
			| ex: algorithm: jacobi
			| 	* 2x2 matrix: one rotation
			|	* eigenvalues with second-order formula (known)
			|	* matrix with known position of largest matrix
			|	  element - use to check that the search
			|	  function works.
